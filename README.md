# Elevator-Controller_FPGA-
Elevator Controller FPGA is a Verilog-based digital design for a 3-floor elevator system implemented on the ZedBoard (Zynq-7000). The project handles inside and outside floor requests, motor up/down control, door open/close logic, floor indication using LEDs, and automatic return to the ground floor using a finite state machine (FSM).
